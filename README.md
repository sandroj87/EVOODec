EVOODec is a tool for calculating the concentration of the pigments usually 
cointened in the extra-virgin olive oil from a spectral deconvolution
of the near-UV / Visible absorption data. The program allows to choose the
spectral range and to select specific pigments to perform the deconvolution.
Automatical and manual deconvolution modes are availble. Results are shown both
in a graphical and in a text form.

A pre-loaded data set containing six pigments is available for deconvolution.
The contribuition of the oil matrix is accounted by also including the
triolein (TRIO) absorption. The pigments actually available are:
* Pheophytin a (Pheo-a)
* Pheophytin b (Pheo-b)
* Beta-Carotene (b-CAR)
* Lutein (LUT)
* Neoxanthin (NEX)
